# Data Science and Social Justice

This repository contains a collection of resources that I've gathered to facilitate a workshops on teaching statistics and data science with a social justice framing.  It includes slides, Jupyter notebooks, publicly available datasets, and some recommended reading.  My views on this topic are always evolving so please let me know if you find these materials to be either useful, or lacking; I'll be grateful for suggestions.

* Slides
* Jupyter notebook - Inside Airbnb
* Jupyter notebook - National Heath and Nutrition Examination Survey
* Jupyter notebook - Twitter

## Recommended Reading

The following books and articles have been really helfpul in framing the way that I think about talk about social justice and quantitative methods.

## Public Datasets

Here are some places where you can find datasets and data related materials that are can be useful in the classroom.

* __International Consortium for Political and Social Research__: The ICPSR maintains a website and searchable database containing both public and restricted data specifically targeted to the social science research community.  It also hosts a page of wonderful [resources for undergraduate educators](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/instructors/teacher-resources.html).
