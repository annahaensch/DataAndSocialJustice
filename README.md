# Resources for Data Science & Social Justice

This repository contains a collection of resources that I've gathered to facilitate a workshops on teaching statistics and data science with a social justice framing.  It includes slides, Jupyter notebooks, publicly available datasets, and some recommended reading.  My views on this topic are always evolving so please let me know if you find these materials to be either useful, or lacking; I'll be grateful for suggestions.

## Recommended Reading

The following books and articles have been really helfpul in framing the way that I think about talk about social justice and quantitative methods like data science, statistics, and algorithmic design.

## Public Datasets

Here are some resources for datasets and data related materials that are can be useful in the classroom.

* __Social Sciences Data__: The [International Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/) hosts a webportal and searchable database containing both public and restricted data specifically targeted to the social science research community.  
* __Census and Survey Data__: Formerly the "Integrated Public Use Microdata Series," the [IPUMS](https://ipums.org/) provides access to international census and survey data, with a special emphasis on social and economic data.
* __Bioclimate Data__: The [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) database provides climate data for 1970-2000 available at high spatial resolution for environmental conditions and time resolutions suitable for studying climate change.
* __Housing Data__: [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) in a non-commercial and independently developed tools and data for analyzing the publicly available information on Airbnb including listing and host metrics as well as GIS data
* __Mortgage Data__: The [Freddie Mac Database](http://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf_loanlevel_dataset.page) provides data on mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac from 1999 through 2020 including original loan conditions, property details and monthly performance.  This requires signing up for login credentials.
* __Twitter Data__: Workshop on [retrieving and analyzing Twitter Data with Python](https://annahaensch.github.io/TwitterAPIWorkshop/), it includes tutorials for several different tools including Tweepy, Twarc and Twurl.  You will need Twitter developer credentials to run the tutorial workbook.
